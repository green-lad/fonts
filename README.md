# About
Inspired by [jeslie0](https://github.com/jeslie0/fonts/tree/main) this is a small nix package with custom fonts I use.
To use it:
- add this flake as input to your nixos or home-manager flake
- add this to nixpkgs.overlays
(see my [nixos config](https://github.com/green-lad/nixos/blob/niri-wayland/flake.nix))
